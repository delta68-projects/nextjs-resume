Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, pioneered the [SOLID pod technology](https://solidproject.org/), which has gained traction, particularly in government sectors like the Belgian government, for decentralizing personal data. This technology facilitates the transfer of data from siloed databases to a centralized location where users have full control and the ability to easily disable data sharing with third-party applications. My research focuses on utilizing semantic data from various providers, merging it into SOLID pods seamlessly, and exploring the practical applications of SOLID pods. This work is conducted in collaboration with VITO and Uhasselt.
