Starting my coding journey at just 11 years old with the iconic "Hello, World!" program in Python ignited a passion within me for the magic of code. Over the years, that spark has grown into a roaring flame of expertise and enthusiasm, particularly in the realms of AI, networking, and cybersecurity.
\
\
Within the vast landscape of technology, I've carved out a niche for myself by assisting companies in navigating the complexities of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Armed with my deep understanding of these subjects, I empower organizations to seamlessly integrate cutting-edge technologies into their operations while ensuring robust security measures are in place. My focus is always on delivering comprehensive, data-driven solutions that address the entirety of the problem at hand.
\
\
What sets me apart is my extensive, foundational knowledge of technologies at a low level. This enables me to approach problem-solving from various perspectives, making me a versatile asset to any team. Learning new frameworks is second nature to me; understanding the underlying architecture allows for rapid adaptation and innovation. This is exemplified by my creations, including my own game engine, compiler.
\
\
Now, my sights are set on mastering cloud technologies, further expanding my skill set and capabilities in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
