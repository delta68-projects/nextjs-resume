I've collaborated with numerous clients, tackling critical business challenges to enhance revenue streams by optimizing day-to-day operations, thus saving valuable time.

My journey commenced as a software engineering intern in 2019, focusing on constructing an in-house knowledge base system. Since then, I've expanded my scope to assist businesses and various non-profit organizations. Constantly seeking challenges, I actively engage with industry leaders and participate in diverse competitions.

\
Last year, our team ranked among the top 10 algorithmic minds in Belgium. Presently, we're delving into cybersecurity by participating in the [CTF challenge in Belgium](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.be/). Making it to the top 10% out of 282 teams in the qualifiers. We now earned us an semi-finals invitation to the Royal Military Academy.

My objective remains clear: leveraging my expertise to propel businesses towards their objectives efficiently.
