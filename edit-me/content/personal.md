Embarked on my coding journey at the tender age of 11 with the classic "Hello, World!" program, I discovered the thrill of bringing lines of code to life. Fast forward to today, and I have evolved into a seasoned professional passionate about the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.

In the realm of technology, I have found my niche in assisting companies as they navigate the intricate landscape of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Leveraging my expertise, I guide organizations through the complexities of integrating cutting-edge technologies securely into their operations.
