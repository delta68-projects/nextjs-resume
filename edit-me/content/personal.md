My journey began in 2019 as a software engineering intern, focusing initially on constructing an in-house knowledge base system. Over time, my endeavors have broadened to encompass support for businesses and various non-profit organizations. Driven by a thirst for challenges, I actively engage with industry leaders and participate in a variety of competitions. Currently, my focus lies in the fields of data science, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.

Throughout my career, I've collaborated with numerous clients, addressing critical business challenges and optimizing day-to-day operations to enhance revenue streams and save valuable time.

Last year, our team was recognized among the top 10 algorithmic minds in Belgium. Presently, we're venturing into cybersecurity through participation in the [CTF challenge in Belgium](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.be/), where our performance in the qualifiers placed us in the top 10% out of 282 teams, earning us a semi-finals invitation to the Royal Military Academy.
