<!-- As a child growing up in India, I was always drawn to tinkering with electronics. Even at a young age, I found solace in taking apart broken toys and crafting makeshift ventilators from spare parts to beat the stifling heat. Little did I know, those moments of ingenuity would set the stage for my lifelong passion for computers and technology.

At the age of nine, my world expanded when my family relocated to Belgium. It was there that I first encountered the wonders of the internet and computers. Instantly captivated, I knew from that moment on that I wanted to pursue a career in the realm of technology.

Since 2019, my mission has been clear: to leverage my skills to drive enterprises forward. I began my journey by joining a consultancy firm, where I fused my expertise to craft innovative business solutions aimed at fostering growth. However, my heart truly lies in the realm of startups, where the pace is fast, the challenges are exhilarating, and the opportunities for learning are boundless.

In my pursuit of mastery, I've always believed in learning from the best. I've been fortunate to collaborate with visionary minds such as CTOs, CEOs, and product managers, absorbing invaluable hard skills and equally crucial soft skills along the way. It's through these interactions that I've not only expanded my technical proficiency but also cultivated essential traits like adaptability, communication, and leadership.

So, if you're looking for someone who not only brings expertise to the table but also possesses an insatiable curiosity and drive to excel, then look no further. Let's collaborate and create something extraordinary together. -->
