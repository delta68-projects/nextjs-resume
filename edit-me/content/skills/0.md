- Firewall configurations and types
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Socket programming

Ethical Hacking:

- Common vulnerabilities and exploits (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
- Web exploitation
- Tools (e.g., Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark)

Azure:

- Azure services overview (e.g., Azure Virtual Machines, Azure App Service)
