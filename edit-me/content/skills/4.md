Machine Learning:

- Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- Natural language processing, Neural networks
- Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
- Ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting)

LLM (Large Language Models):

- Training methodologies for large language models
- Fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques
- Ethical considerations in deploying LLMs

Python, Rust:

- Syntax and basic constructs
- Memory management in Rust (e.g., ownership, borrowing)
- Python libraries for data science (e.g., NumPy, pandas)

HuggingFaces:

- Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (e.g., text classification, named entity recognition)
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models with Hugging Face's Transformers library

PySpark, Kafka, Pandas:

- PySpark for distributed data processing
- Kafka for real-time streaming data
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis in Python

Serverless ML:

- Deploying machine learning models as serverless functions
- AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions for serverless computing
- Scaling and cost considerations in serverless ML deployments

PyTorch, TensorFlow:

- Deep learning frameworks basics
- Building neural networks (e.g., layers, activations, loss functions)
- GPU acceleration and distributed training in PyTorch and TensorFlow
